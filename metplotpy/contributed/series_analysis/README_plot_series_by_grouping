Background
==========


Pre-requisites:
===============
Python packages:
---------------
-matplotlib
-netCDF4
-cartopy
-numpy
-imageio
Python 3.6

Input files:
------------
-netcdf output files generated from running the feature_relative use case from METplus via the feature_relative.conf and
examples/series_by_lead_all_fhrs config files.


Input Required:
===============
The series_lead_group.yaml file is a configuration file where you set the location of your input, output, and other
relevant settings.  This file is found in the same directory as the plot_series_by_grouping.py script.



Output generated:
=================
First, the png (static plots) files are generated and stored in the output directory specified, under the plots/
subdirectory.  Then, all obar files are collected, ordered and combined to create an animation file (gif) under this
same subdirectory.  The process is repeated for the fbar files.

How to run:
==========
set your PYTHONPATH to point to your $HOME/METplotpy directory

The script runs "out of the box" on the host 'kiowa', using data and input, etc. that corresponds to the sample
data located in /d1/projects/METplus/METplus_Plotting_Data/series_analysis

cd to $METplotpy/metplotpy/contributed/series_analysis/

from the command line, run the following command:
python ./plot_series_by_grouping.py ./series_lead_group.yaml


png and gif files are generated in the /d1/projects/METplus/METplus_Plotting_Data/series_by_lead_grouing/plots directory
