# FV3 physics plotting package
Python scripts to plot physics tendencies from FV3 model

## Description
Calculate mean tendencies of temperature, moisture, and momentum over a time window and spatial domain. Tendencies are partitioned into physics parameterizations and model dynamics. The residual is defined as the difference between the actual change in the state variable and the sum of the physics and dynamics tendencies. One can plot a single tendency at multiple pressure levels or plot all tendencies at a single pressure level. Plan views (horizontal cross sections) and vertical profiles are available.
