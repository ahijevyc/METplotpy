Background:
==========
The plot_series_by_lead_all.py script generates static plots of each netcdf input file generated by running the
feature relative use case with the feature_relative.conf and examples/series_by_lead_all_fhrs.conf file.  The script
only supports netcdf input file format that would be expected from running the use case with the above specified
config files.  In the future, the plotting script will provide support to allow users to specify their own netcdf file
formats.  For now, it is expected that netcdf files will have the file format of series_F<hhh>_<variable>_<level_type><level>.png
where hhh is forecast hour, variable is the variable of interest (eg. TMP, HGT, etc.), level_type is pressure level or level
above ground (eg. P or Z) and level is the value of the level (eg. 850, 500, 2, etc).


Pre-requisites:
===============
Python packages:
---------------
-Python 3.6
-matplotlib
-cartopy
-netCDF4

Data:
-----
netcdf output from running the feature relative use case that performs a series analysis by lead time for all forecast
hours.


Input required:
===============
in the code, under the 'def main()' section, set the following:
-input_dir_base  The base directory where all the input data resides
-output_base_dir  the base directory where output files will be saved


Output generated:
================
for each netcdf file, there will be a corresponding .png file in the output directory.


How to run:
==========

cd to the $METplotpy/src/series_analysis directory.  On the host 'eyewall', the script is set up to run "out of the
box" using the sample data in the /d1/METplus_Plotting_Data/series_by_lead_all directory.

from the command line, run the following command:


python ./plot_series_by_lead_all.py
