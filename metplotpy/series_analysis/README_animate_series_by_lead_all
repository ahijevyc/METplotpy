Background:
===========
This script creates animations (gif file) from the static plots (png format) that were generated from the netcdf
output of the feature relative use case which performs a series analysis by lead time for all forecast hours.


Pre-requisites:
==============
Python packages:
    -Python 3.6
    -imageio


Input:
=====
Assign the appropriate values to the following (in the 'def main()') section of the code.
The code can be run 'out of the box', using sample data on the host 'eyewall'.
-input_dir  The directory where the static (png) plots to be combined into an animation
-output_dir  The directory where the animations (gif files) are to be stored
-fhrs_list  A list of the fhrs to include in the animation, in the format ["Faa", "Fbb", ..., "Fzz"] where
            aa, bb, ..., zz refer to the forecast hours of interest.
-variable  The variable of interest (e.g. TMP, UGRD, VGRD, etc.)
-level_type  The level type (e.g. P or Z)
-level  The level of interest, e.g. 500 in P500, Z as in Z2, etc.
-filename_regex The regular expression that describes the format of the static files (.png file)  For the feature
                relative use case, the files have the format of:
                        .*series_F([0-9]{3})_([A-Z]{3})_((P|Z)[0-9]{1,3})_(obar|fbar).png

                where the values in the parenthesis refer to the fhr, variable, level type, level, and statistic,
                respectively.
-output_gif_base  The 'base' or first part of the output filename to be created.
-duration The time (in sec) that each frame of the animation is viewed


Output:
======
Creates a gif file for each variable-level-statistic combination (as specified) in the output directory in the output/series_animate_python
sub-directory.


How to run:
===========
The script runs "out of the box" on the host 'eyewall', using data and input, etc. that corresponds to the sample
data located in /d1/METplus_Plotting_Data/series_analysis

cd to $METplotpy/src/series_analysis/

from the command line, run the following command:
python ./plot_series_by_lead_all.py


gif files are generated in the /d1/METplus_Plotting_Data/series_by_lead_all/plots directory
