MaKE MaKI Plots
***************

Description
===========

The **plot_mjo_enso.py** code (found in the METplotpy repository)
supports the generation of the ENSO MaKE MaKI calculation and plotting.
These indices are calculated by **compute_mjo_enso.py** in the METcalcpy
repository. These modules are used as part of METplus use cases.


Run from the Command Line
=========================

There are `METplus use cases
<https://metplus.readthedocs.io/en/latest/generated/model_applications/index.html#subseasonal-to-seasonal>`_
which illustrate how to generate the MaKE MaKI plot:

* To generate a MaKE MaKI, follow the instructions in the METplus users guide on the UserScript_obsCFSR_obsOnly_MJO_ENSO use case:


Instructions for obtaining sample data and all necessary configuration files
are indicated in the use cases. The use cases invoke the necessary
modules from the METplotpy and METcalcpy repositories.  


Required Packages:
==================

* metplotpy
* numpy 
* matplotlib
