Background:
==========
The plog_series_by_init.py script takes as input, the netcdf file generated by the feature_relative use case (via
running the feature_relative.conf or feature_relative.conf and series_by_init_12-14_to_12-16.conf files).

Pre-requisites:
===============

Python packages:
---------------
-matplotlib
-netCDF4
-cartopy
-numpy
Python 3.6

Input files:
------------
-netcdf output files from running the feature_relative use case from METplus via 1) the feature_relative.conf file or
2) the feature_relative.conf and examples/series_by_init_12-14_to_12-16.conf file.

Input required:
==============
The user specifies the following in the plot_series_by_init.py script (in the bottom section of the code):
-storm number, which corresponds to the subdirectory under the $OUTPUT_DIR/YYYYMMDD_hh/ directory created by the METplus
use case.
-nc_input_dir_base, the $OUTPUT_DIR/YYYYMMDD_hh directory under which the output is saved based on the storm number.
-nc_input_filename, the filename of the netcdf file of interest
-variable_name, the variable name of interest, which is found in the nc_input_filename above.
-level - the level (level type ie P or Z) and level value (ie 850 or 2) of interest.


Output created:
==============
A plot is generated of the variable+level of interest for the storm number associated that is in the netcdf input file.
The file is saved to the directory where the netcdf output resides, with a filename of format <variable>_<level>_<statistic>.png
where variable is the variable of interest (ie TMP, UBAR, HGT, etc.), level is the level of interest (ie P500, Z2, etc.),
and statistic is either fbar or obar.


How to run:
===========
The plot_series_by_init.py is initially set up to run, using output data on host 'eyewall', under the /d1/METplus_Plotting_Data/series_by_init directory.

To run, 'cd' to $METplotpy/src/series_analysis/ and run the following:

python ./plot_series_by_init.py

you will see output to stdout that shows the lat, lon, FBAR, and OBAR values for the file+variable+level+statistic of
interest and the name of the output files created.
